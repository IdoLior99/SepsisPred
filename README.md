**Reproduction Instructions:**
1. Generate the basic dataset pickle files by uncommenting and running the "generating pickle file" comment block
2. Run the sampling algorithm to create necessary downsampled train sets, both for validation and final model  training.
3. Uncomment and run the run_final_model functions to train the networks on the whole (downsampled)
train set, and evaluate it on the entirety of the test set.
